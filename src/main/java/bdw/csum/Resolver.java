/**
 * This class takes to EntryQueues, and reports on differences
 * between them. Given the assumed order of the two reports (old and new)
 * this reports on files added (in the second but not the first),
 * removed (in first but not the second), changed (same path in both, but
 * different checksums), unchanged (same path and checksum in both) and
 * moved or renamed (same checksum in both, different path).  This last
 * set is the least reliable, since it isn't unreasonable to have
 * files with the same contents in different places in the system, and
 * this may think such a file has been moved or renamed even if it really is
 * removed from the old list and added in the new.  As a heuristic to reduce
 * the mistakes there, if there are two files in the new report which
 * have the same checksum, this will ignore them and consider the old one
 * to have been removed and these to be added.
 * This also can't detect a file that was
 * moved and changed (which will look like an added and removed file).
